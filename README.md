# 2048_ai
    This is a simple implementation of 2048 in Python
    The constraints of this game are a little modified from the original 2048 game
    Solutions are generated by an Iterative-Deepening Depth First Tree Search

## To run
    where "input.txt" the the name of your test file:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh input.txt
    ```


## Input
    input file describes:
    line 1: the goal tile value
    line 2: width and height of game board
    line 3: pool of spawn tiles
    lines 4-on: initial state of game board

## Output
    output describes:
    line 1: time program took to get solution(in microseconds)
    line 2: number of moves to get to solution
    line 3: list of charcters describing the moves to get to solution
    lines 4-on: final state of game board
