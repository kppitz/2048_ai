# 2048_ai
# This is a simple implementation of 2048 in Python
# Solutions are generated by an Iterative-Deepening Depth First Tree Search
# To run, where "input.txt" the the name of your test file
# ./run.sh input.txt




# The constraints of this game are a little modified from the original 2048 game
# input file describes:
# line 1: the goal tile value
# line 2: width and height of game board
# line 3: pool of spawn tiles
# lines 4-on: initial state of game board

# output describes:
# line 1: time program took to get solution(in microseconds)
# line 2: number of moves to get to solution
# line 3: list of charcters describing the moves to get to solution
# lines 4-on: final state of game board
